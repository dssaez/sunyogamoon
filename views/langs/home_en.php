                        My name is Daniel, I'm a engineer computer science and
                        I do <strong class="strongnormal"> web design, layout and development. </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                        Computer science is a large discipline which is divided in differents
                        connected areas but difficult to cover all of them at the same time. That's why,
                        the students which are interested of being engineer, sooner or later, decided to spend
                        his time in being an expert of one or some of these areas. Therefore, the two
                        thesis I have done in the university, which were web applications, helped me
                        start in this wide world web.
                </p>
                <p>
                        But even like this, there were another areas which I was interested on and I considered
                        them important to learn, therefore I spent 5 years working as expert of
                        networking and internet and linux server administator maintenance. During
                        this period I had never left the web because I used to develope some applications
                        which made me easier my job.

                <p>
                        So, after this working experience, I had come back to the web development
                        with knowledges of networking and linux servers which made me see much more
                        clear the global picture of the different parts that form an entire application
                        or a simple web, and allowed me to add a more suistainable, secure and
                        scalable foundation to the projects I develop.
